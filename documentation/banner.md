# Banner

The CLI banner refers to the uppermost display when running the CLI. This banner may be overwritten by including a banner.txt file at the root of the project that includes the new banner in ascii format. A tool that may be used to generate this banner may be found [here](https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/)
